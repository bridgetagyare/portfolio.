          <strong>Bio:</strong>
          <br>
          My name is Bridget Agyare and I am a girl who codes from the San Francisco Bay Area. As I approach my junior year of highschool, I look forward to playing volleyball and becoming a part of the programming community at my school. My favorite things to do are exercising, playing sports, and listening to music. I hope that I can find a way to combine these interests with my growing knowledge on computer science.
